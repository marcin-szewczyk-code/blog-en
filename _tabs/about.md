I started playing with the Internet about 30 years ago, in the first Polish domain: ```fuw.edu.pl```. It was an interesting time to be there.

Later, I experimented a bit with static and dynamic websites – first on ```fuw.edu.pl```, then a bit more on ```ee.pw.edu.pl```. I built static pages in ```HTML```, and dynamic ones in ```C++```, sending them to the browser via ```CGI```. Later I rewrote them in ```PHP``` and added ```CSS```. ```LaTeX``` was also part of the adventure.

As far as I remember, there was no Google back then – and a few other things didn’t exist either.

Now I’m coming back to this.

Here is the first post about the blog: [How This Blog Started](/posts/blog-origin/).

Maybe I’ll publish more entries here from time to time.
