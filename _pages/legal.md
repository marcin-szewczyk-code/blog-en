## Copyright and License

This blog is part of a long-term writing project.
Its content may later be revised, expanded, and published as a book generated from LaTeX sources.

For this reason, the licensing model is intentionally conservative.

### Text and editorial content

All textual content, structure, and original illustrations published on this blog are protected by copyright.

> © Marcin Szewczyk. All rights reserved.

This means that without prior written permission of the author it is not permitted to:

reproduce posts in full,

publish translations,

distribute or sell compilations,

reuse content commercially.

Short excerpts may be quoted with proper attribution in accordance with applicable copyright law.

### Source code

Source code published in separate repositories may be licensed under a different license, for example the MIT License.

This separation is intentional:

- editorial content → protected (All rights reserved),

- source code → may be open source.

Each repository defines its own license in its LICENSE file.

### Footer notice

The site footer displays:

© 2026–YYYY Marcin Szewczyk. All rights reserved.

where YYYY is the current year.

This indicates the starting year of the project and its ongoing development.

The per-post notice displays:

© Marcin Szewczyk. All rights reserved.

It applies to each individual article as a separate work and follows the same copyright model as the overall project.
