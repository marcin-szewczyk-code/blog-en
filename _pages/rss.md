This blog provides an **RSS (Atom)** feed that you can add to a reader (e.g. Feedly, Inoreader).

In this way, you can receive notifications about new posts published on this blog:

- Feed address: /feed.xml
- You can also simply open the feed: Open [feed.xml](/feed.xml)

> After opening it, you will see an XML file – this is normal. The feed is intended for RSS readers, not for direct reading in a web browser.

## How to use the RSS feed

You can add the feed to applications such as:
- Feedly (a browser-based reader)
- NetNewsWire (popular on macOS / iOS)
- Mozilla Thunderbird (an email client with RSS support)
- RSS extensions for Chrome or Edge
- any other application that supports Atom/RSS feeds

**RSS** (*Really Simple Syndication*) is a standard format that allows one to follow website updates in dedicated readers. New posts appear automatically after they are published.

This solution is especially useful for **smaller, independent websites** that do not use built-in subscription systems (such as newsletters or email notifications).

## How it looks in an RSS app

Below is an example of how this blog’s RSS feed looks in an RSS application on an iPhone:
