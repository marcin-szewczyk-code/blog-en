I went out for lunch with a software engineer and an automation engineer joined us. It turned into a good conversation. That’s when I learned there’s something called Jekyll – and that it’s great. I set it up for myself, added the Chirpy theme, and wrote a bit of automation in Python.

I bought a domain, created a Jekyll-Chirpy repository on GitHub, deployed everything via GitHub Pages, and configured domain redirection. And that’s how it came into existence.

The blog is generated from Markdown, pushed to Git from VS Code. It’s fully static – and that’s the beauty of it. It has useful plugins, like the JavaScript library MathJax for rendering LaTeX. I commit, I push, and it just works. If I ever decide to switch themes, I can – because all the content lives in Markdown.

This blog is a place for my notes on code, mathematics, and simulations.

The easiest way to browse the blog content is through the [Categories](/categories/) or [Archive](/archives/) sections.

The blog offers [RSS subscription](/rss/), two language versions ([PL](https://blog.marcinszewczyk.net/) \| [EN](https://en.blog.marcinszewczyk.net/)), and a light/dark mode toggle in the header.

Information about me can be found in the [About](/about/) section.

Time will tell whether I keep posting here.
