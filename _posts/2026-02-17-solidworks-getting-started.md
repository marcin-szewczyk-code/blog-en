This blog was created, among other reasons, to document engineering tools of this kind. SolidWorks is a computer-aided design (CAD) system widely used in mechanical engineering, including applications in the electrical power industry.

This post is a short “getting started” guide: training materials, certification, and exams.

## Certification (CSWA)

Once working in SOLIDWORKS becomes comfortable, you may proceed to the CSWA exam: [https://www.solidworks.com/certifications/mechanical-design-cswa-mechanical-design](https://www.solidworks.com/certifications/mechanical-design-cswa-mechanical-design).

Courses and exercises preparing for the CSWA exam:
- Exam Prep Course
  [https://my.solidworks.com/training/path/14/cswa-exam-prep-course](https://my.solidworks.com/training/path/14/cswa-exam-prep-course)
- Practice Exams
  [https://my.solidworks.com/training/path/13/cswa-practice-exams](https://my.solidworks.com/training/path/13/cswa-practice-exams)

It is recommended to complete these learning paths in order.

After that, you can proceed directly to CSWA exam preparation (sample exam):
