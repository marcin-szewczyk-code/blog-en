Why Windows? Because SolidWorks and PSCAD are available only for Windows. And for me, these are essential programs.

For that reason, Windows is my primary working system.

## What I Disable

Things I turn off:

- startup applications  
- notifications  
- distractions (news, widgets, suggestions — anything that “moves” on its own)

I will expand this section when configuring Windows on a new laptop.

## What I Add

### Tools

- VS Code (with extensions)
- Python
- TeXstudio
- Chrome with the Google Scholar Button extension

### Simulation Software

- EMTP-ATP
- PSCAD
- MATLAB and Octave
- Wolfram Mathematica
- SolidWorks
- ANSYS
- COMSOL Multiphysics

I will describe these programs in separate posts when the time comes (if it comes).

## A Few Details

Chrome with the Google Scholar Button extension is useful for quickly checking articles and citations.

For now, this is enough. I will add more when setting up Windows on a new laptop.
