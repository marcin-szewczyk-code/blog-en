Jekyll has several nice features. The first one: the blog is static and
built from posts written in Markdown. Below is a simple "Hello World" example -- a few elements that I use most often.

The blog content is generated by Jekyll as a static site and served by
GitHub. What I edit are plain text files in Markdown, with simple syntax.
Below are the basic elements I use: headings, lists, code, and links.
This is enough to write and publish a post.
In addition, there is metadata: title, date, category, and tags.

Jekyll ensures that posts appear only when their date arrives.
This makes it easy to schedule publications in a controlled rhythm.

Posts are stored locally in the `_posts` directory, with a very
convenient filename format: date `yyyy-mm-dd`, then the name, and the
`.md` extension. Example: `2026-02-07-jekyll-markdown-hello-world.md`.

When I add new `.md` files to the local `_posts` directory, they are
immediately visible locally at `127.0.0.1:4000`, and on the live blog
after `commit` and `push`.

So the workflow is simple: create a `.md` file, save it locally in
`_posts`, `commit` and `push` -- the post goes to the repository and
appears according to its date.

## "Hello World" Post in Markdown

### Metadata (front matter / head)

At the beginning there is front matter (header) containing metadata
recognized by Jekyll.

``` yaml
---                                      # Start of front matter
title: "Hello-world markdown for Jekyll" # Displayed as page heading
description: "Example of Jekyll front matter (YAML) structure with basic metadata fields."
date: 2026-02-06 08:00:00 +0100          # Publication date and time; used by Jekyll for sorting and publishing
categories: [Blog]                       # Post category (or list of categories)
tags: [blog, jekyll]                     # List of tags for classification and filtering
---                                      # End of front matter
```

### Directory Structure Convention

Posts are placed in the Jekyll "special" directory `_posts`. The filename example: `2026-02-07-jekyll-markdown-hello-world.md`.

All materials related to a given post are stored in a separate directory:

``` text
assets/
└── posts/
    └── jekyll-markdown-hello-world/
        ├── cauchy.png
        ├── plot.svg
        ├── data.csv
        └── cauchy.pdf
```

This directory contains all files related to the post: images, PDFs, auxiliary data, etc.

In the post content, I reference them by path :

``` markdown
[Caption](/assets/posts/jekyll-markdown-hello-world/cauchy.png)
```

### Post Content (content / body)

The content begins directly after the metadata.

Text is plain text, e.g.: "I created a blog, so the question arose what
to write so that the blog has at least one post."

Text formatting: **bold**, *italic*, ***bold and italic***, ***bold** and italic*.

``` markdown
Text formatting: **bold**, *italic*,
***bold and italic***, ***bold** and italic*.
```

### Links

A link like this: [https://marcinszewczyk.net/](https://marcinszewczyk.net/)

``` markdown
[link text](https://marcinszewczyk.net/)
```

### Headings

They are used for table of contents, anchors, and SEO (Search Engine Optimization):

``` markdown
# Level 1 heading
## Level 2 heading
### Level 3 heading
```

### Figures

Example figure:

![Cauchy's Theorem](/assets/posts/jekyll-markdown-hello-world/cauchy.png)
***Fig. 1.** Geometric interpretation of Cauchy's theorem.*

Code:

``` markdown
<!-- note: no blank line between the image and the caption -->
![Cauchy’s Theorem](/assets/posts/jekyll-markdown-hello-world/cauchy.png)
***Fig. 1.** Geometric interpretation of Cauchy’s theorem.*
```

Linking to files: same as above, just without "!".

### Lists

Unordered list:
- list item
- **text** -- bold
- `text` -- inline code

``` markdown
- list item
- **text** -- bold
- `text` -- inline code
```

Ordered list:
1. list item
2. **text** -- bold
3. `text` -- inline code

code

``` markdown
1. list item
2. **text** — bold
3. `text` — inline code
```

### Code

Inline code:

``` markdown
`inline code`
```
